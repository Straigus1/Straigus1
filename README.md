### Hi there. I'm Dayton, based in Pottstown, Pennsylvania! ðŸ‘‹

<br></br>

### I've recently graduated from Flatiron School's Software Engineering Live Program. Experienced with JavaScript and Ruby on Rails and have a background in Customer Service. Enthusiast of recognizing joy and retaining happiness. At the moment, I'm most interested in front-end development. Especially comfortable with React and JavaScript. Currently learning redux and editting my capstone project.
