## Hi there! I'm Dayton(Lyrik)!👋

  Based in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. I've recently graduated from Flatiron School's Software Engineering Live Program. Experienced with JavaScript and Ruby on Rails and have a background in Customer Service. Enthusiast of recognizing joy and retaining happiness. 
  
  At the moment, I'm most interested in front-end development. Especially comfortable with React and JavaScript. Currently learning redux, editting my capstone project, creating demo videos, and deploying projects.
